- Hi, I’m @christian-gw
- I’m interested in Acoustics, Vibration, Process and Condition Monitoring (... and a little bit of / load of climbing).
- I’m currently learning to create python scripts and modules other people can use and contribute.
- I’m looking to collaborate on scripting stuff you could buy of big companies and be unhappy about it for different reasons. 
- How to reach me ... ... Github probably? idk...
