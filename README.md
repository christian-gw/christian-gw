- Hi, I’m @christian-gw
- I’m interested in Acoustics, Vibration, Process and Condition Monitoring (... and a little bit of / load of climbing).
- I’m currently learning to create python scripts and modules other people can use and contribute.
- A lot of the things I try here are already implementet better in open and probrietarry software. 
- I do it for my own learning mainly.
- How to reach me ... ... Github probably? idk...
